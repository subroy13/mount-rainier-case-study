# Mount Rainier: The Climber's Challenge

### Abstract
Many mountaineers aim to climb Mt. Rainier (located 59 miles south east of Seattle, Washington) during different times of the year, in different group sizes and via different routes. Based on the historical data on successful and failed climbing attempts in conjunction with the weather data, we analyze different types of regression model to model the success probability. This can prove useful to the mountaineers to avoid certain routes and certain weather conditions to assess the probability of a successful expedition.
